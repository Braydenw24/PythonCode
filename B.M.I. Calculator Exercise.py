#Body Mass Index Calculator

# 1st input: enter height in meters e.g: 1.65
height = input()
# 2nd input: enter weight in kilograms e.g: 72
weight = input()
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

# Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡

height_2 = float(height)
weight_2 = float(weight)


print(int(weight_2/(height_2*height_2)))

#Note to self: Spectacular job solving this by yourself! Remove the int type conversion to get a floating point number and a more accurate B.M.I.
