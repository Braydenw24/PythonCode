#Mathematical Operators in Python 3

# Addition:  +
# Subtraction: -
# Multiplciation: *
# Division: /   Note, division will alway print as a floating point number.
# ** calculates exponents
#Operatiors follow PEMDAS. Multiplication and division are equal-- the leftmost operation, between multiplication and division, is prioritized! PEMDASLR

print(3+5)
print(9-1)
print(4*2)
#print(64/8) gives a floating point, so I used typed conversion.
print(int(64/8))
print(4**4)

#print(3*3+3/3-3) I don't like the floating point number-- it is not clean enough. 
print(int(3*3+3/3-3))

#Challenge: change the code sum to 3 instead of 7!

print(int(3*(3+3/3-3)))

#Nice job! I solved the problem without being handed partial answers! I am getting better at Python!
